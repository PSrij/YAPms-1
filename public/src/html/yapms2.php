    YAPms 2 Development
  </h3>
  <p>
    A new version of YAPms is in development. It will be a complete rewrite of the codebase, and will be a much more powerful tool.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Modern Web Framework:</b> will allow us to more quickly develop features and add maps.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Standardized Map Format:</b> will let community members more easily create maps themselves.
  </p>
